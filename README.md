# Page monitor
This is a script for an adidas monitor. It will send an email and text once the key word is found on the page you would like to monitor.
I created this for the adidas Yeezy page.


Getting Started
Download a copy of run.py and run this on your local machine however as this is a monitor it is best to run it on a server so you can have it running all the time.

Prerequisites
Python 3
beautiful soup 4
twilio
